/**
    * Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the underlying causes of problems or events.
    * It aims to address the root cause rather than just treating the symptoms, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.
    * Common techniques include the 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, and Fault Tree Analysis.
    * RCA is widely used in various fields such as engineering, healthcare, and business to improve processes and prevent recurrence of issues.
